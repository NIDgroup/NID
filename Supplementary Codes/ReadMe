Here, we have additional supplementary codes (cited in the paper Jamshidi Idaji et al) in MATLAB live script/mfile/PDF formats.

These scripts are a part of the supplementary material for the following paper:

-  Jamshidi Idaji et al,  "Nonlinear Interaction Decomposition (NID): A Method 
for Separation of Cross-frequency Coupled Sources in Human Brain". doi: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116599>

-> The simulation pipeline is based on the code used in:

Nikulin, V.V., Nolte, G., Curio, G., 2012. Cross-frequency decomposi-
tion: A novel technique for studying interactions between neuronal oscilla-
tions with different frequencies. Clinical Neurophysiology 123, 1353â€“1360.
doi:10.1016/j.clinph.2011.12.004.

any significant usage of this script or the simulation pipeline.
