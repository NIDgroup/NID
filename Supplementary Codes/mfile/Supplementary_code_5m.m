%% Realistic EEG Simulations: A Comprehensive Tutorial
% In this script, we go through our realistic EEG simulation pipeline of our 
% paper.
% 
% *Please cite the above papers (or a future peer-reviewed version) in case 
% of any significant usage of this script or the simulation pipeline.*
% 
% For this script, you will need the <https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/neurophysiology-and-pathophysiology/research/research-groups/index.html 
% METH toolbox>.  You can download the pipeline from our <https://github.com/minajamshidi/NID 
% GitHub>. Please download the package and add its to your MATLAB's directory 
% - we will use one of its function in this script.
% 
% In the following we will go through the function |Produce_EEG_CFC| for simulation 
% of realistic EEG with CFC coupled sources.
%% Parameter Settings
% First, add the path of METH toolbox:

%NID_dir = './NID_GitHub'; % you may add your own directory
%meth_dir = './meth'; % you may add your own directory
%addpath(genpath(meth_dir));
%addpath(genpath(NID_dir));
%% 
% The parameter of the fuction |Produce_EEG_CFC| are:

PairsNum = 2; %number of the coupled pairs 
FrBase = 10; % base frequency in Hz.
% The CFC osillations will be at frequencies FrP*FrBase and FrQ*FrBase.
FrP = 1; % frequency ratio of the slow oscillation
FrQ = 2;  % frequency ratio of the fast oscillation
Fs = 500; % sampling frequency
SNR = 0.3162; % signal-to-noise ratio
PhaseLag_q = 0; % phase lag of the coupled oscilaltions
T_sec = 5*60; % length of the simulated signal in seconds
seed = 4443000; %random seed for reproducing the results
%seed = randperm(9999999,1); % you may generate new seeds 
%% 
% Now we load the head model and set some more parameters:

rng(seed,'twister'); % for reproducing the results
load('sa_eeg.mat'); % the head 
source_analysis = sa; clear sa;

electrode_locs = source_analysis.locs_2D; % electrode locations
T = Fs * T_sec; %number of time samples in the signal
NoiseNum = 125;% number of pink noise sources
SourceNum = PairsNum * 2;
%% 
% Note that in the function we put all the parameters in a structure and then 
% unpack it in the next function.
% 
% Build the filters:

[butter_base_b, butter_base_a] = butter(2,[FrBase-1 FrBase+1]/(Fs/2));          
[butter_p_b, butter_p_a] = butter(2,[FrP*FrBase-1 FrP*FrBase+1]/(Fs/2));    
[butter_q_b, butter_q_a] = butter(2,[FrQ*FrBase-1 FrQ*FrBase+1]/(Fs/2));  
%% Simulating the Dipoles
% The next step is to simulate the dipoles and do the forward modelling to generate 
% the mixing patterns of the sources. This is done in the function |mk_model_mni|, 
% which we expand in the following code segments.
% 
% First: we generate the noise dipoles by making a grid of 5x5x5 and selecting 
% a dipole from each cell randomely. With this we gaurantee that the noise dipoles 
% are homogeneously distributed over the cortical mantle and are not located at 
% a specific region.

% generate noise dipoles
N = ceil(nthroot(NoiseNum,3));
vc = source_analysis.cortex.vc;
vc_x = vc(:,1);
vc_y = vc(:,2);
vc_z = vc(:,3);
x_bins = linspace(min(vc_x)-0.1,  max(vc_x)+0.1, N+1);
y_bins = linspace(min(vc_y)-0.1,  max(vc_y)+0.1, N+1);
z_bins = linspace(min(vc_z)-0.1,  max(vc_z)+0.1, N+1);
n = 0;
dipole_pos_3d_noise = NaN(N^3,3);
for ix = 1:N
    for iy = 1:N
        for iz = 1:N
            n = n + 1;
            IND = vc_x>=x_bins(ix) & vc_x<x_bins(ix+1) & ...
                vc_y>=y_bins(iy) & vc_y<y_bins(iy+1) & ...
                vc_z>=z_bins(iz) & vc_z<z_bins(iz+1);
            if ~sum(IND)
                dipole_pos_3d_noise(n,:) = [];
                n = n - 1;
            else
                vc_ind = vc(IND,:);
                idx_vox = randi(sum(IND), 1);
                dipole_pos_3d_noise(n, :) = vc_ind(idx_vox,:);
            end
            
        end
    end
end
NoiseNum = size(dipole_pos_3d_noise, 1);
%% 
% Second: we generate the dipole orientations. For this purpose, the orientaions 
% (dipole_orient_3d) are produced by selecting a random point with radius 1 in 
% the spherical coordinate system, i.e. the azimuth and elevation of the orientation 
% vector are selected randomely from uniform distributions between $\left\lbrack 
% -\pi ,\pi \right\rbrack$ and $\left\lbrack -\frac{\pi }{2},\frac{\pi }{2}\right\rbrack$ 
% respectively. Please check the supplementary code (4) for code and discussion 
% to see that the dipoles' orientations's azimuth and elevation has a uniform 
% distribution.  

theta_phi = rand(NoiseNum+SourceNum,2); % the random numbers for producing azimuth 
% and elevation
theta = theta_phi(:,1)*2*pi - pi; % azimuth, between [-pi/2, pi/2]
phi = theta_phi(:,2)*pi - pi/2; % elevation between [-pi, pi]
[X, Y, Z] = ...
    sph2cart(theta, phi, ones(NoiseNum+SourceNum, 1)); 
    % convert spherical coordinates to cartesian. Note that the radius is 
    % set to one.
dipole_orient_3d = [X, Y, Z]; % cartesian coordinates

dipole_orient_3d_sig = ...
    dipole_orient_3d(1:SourceNum,:); % signal sources
dipole_orient_3d_noise = ...
    dipole_orient_3d(SourceNum+1:SourceNum+NoiseNum,:); % noise sources
%% 
% The position of the dipole is selected as a random node among the nodes of 
% the cortex. Please check the supplementary code (4) for code and discussion 
% to see that dipoles are distributed randomely on the cortical surface.

dipole_idx = ...
    randperm(size(source_analysis.cortex.vc,1)); 
    % shuffle the vertices on the cortex.
dipole_pos_3d_sig = ...
    source_analysis.cortex.vc(dipole_idx(1:SourceNum),:); % signal sources
%% 
% Now we do the forward modeling to generate the mixing patterns. It is based 
% on (Nolte and Dassios, 2005).

pattern_sig = ...
    forward_general([dipole_pos_3d_sig dipole_orient_3d_sig],...
    source_analysis.fp);
pattern_noise = ...
    forward_general([dipole_pos_3d_noise dipole_orient_3d_noise],...
    source_analysis.fp);

pattern_sig_p = ...
    pattern_sig(:,1:PairsNum); % mixing patterns for the slow oscillations
pattern_sig_q = ...
    pattern_sig(:,PairsNum+1:SourceNum);  % mixing patterns for the fast oscillations
%% 
% Let's look at the mixing patterns of the signal sources:

figure, 
subplot(2,1,1)
showfield(pattern_sig_p(:,1), electrode_locs);
title('simulated mixing pattern. slow-signal. (1)')
colorbar('off'), colorbar('southoutside')
set(findall(gca, 'type', 'text'), 'visible', 'on')
subplot(2,1,2)
showfield(pattern_sig_p(:,2), electrode_locs);
title('simulated mixing pattern. slow-signal. (2)')
colorbar('off'), colorbar('southoutside')
set(findall(gca, 'type', 'text'), 'visible', 'on')

figure, 
subplot(2,1,1)
showfield(pattern_sig_q(:,1), electrode_locs);
title('simulated mixing pattern. fast-signal. (1)')
colorbar('off'), colorbar('southoutside')
set(findall(gca, 'type', 'text'), 'visible', 'on')

title('simulated mixing pattern. fast-signal. (2)')
colorbar('off'), colorbar('southoutside')
set(findall(gca, 'type', 'text'), 'visible', 'on')
%% Generating the Source Signals
% Now it is the time to generate the source signals in function |mk_elec_CFC|.  
% In this script, we only bring the phase-coupled option. This is done by producing 
% a base oscilaltion by filtering a white Gaussian noise in the range of the base 
% frequency. Then the slow and fast oscillations are built by multiplying the 
% phase of the base oscillation by the ratios defined at the beigining of the 
% script.

sb = filtfilt(butter_base_b,butter_base_a,randn(T,PairsNum)); 
sp = filtfilt(butter_p_b,butter_p_a,randn(T,PairsNum));  % for using its envelope
sq = filtfilt(butter_q_b,butter_q_a,randn(T,PairsNum)); % for using its envelope
% filter a random white Gaussian noise in the range of FrBase

sb_cplx = hilbert(sb); % analytic signal
sp_abs = abs(hilbert(sp)); % amplitude envelope of a signal at fp
sq_abs = abs(hilbert(sq)); % amplitude envelope of a signal at fq
src_sig_p = real(sp_abs.*exp(1i.*(FrP*angle(sb_cplx)))); 
% build the slow frequency from the base signal, by multiplying its phase 
abs_q = sq_abs;
src_sig_q = real(abs_q.*exp(1i.*(FrQ*angle(sb_cplx) + PhaseLag_q)));
%% 
% Let's look at the phase-locking value (PLV) of the two sources, their spectrum, 
% and a short segment of their time series:

cPLV = mean(exp(1i*FrQ*angle(hilbert(src_sig_p)))...
    .*exp(-1i*FrP*angle(hilbert(src_sig_q))),1)'

figure,
plot_psd(src_sig_p, Fs, 35);
title('The PSD of the slow-frequency oscillation')
set(gca, 'fontweight', 'bold', 'fontsize', 12)
figure,
plot_psd(src_sig_q, Fs, 35);
title('The PSD of the fast-frequency oscillation')
set(gca, 'fontweight', 'bold', 'fontsize', 12)

times = (0:T-1)/Fs;
figure,
plot(times(2*Fs:4*Fs), src_sig_p(2*Fs:4*Fs,1), 'linewidth',2), hold on,
plot(times(2*Fs:4*Fs), src_sig_q(2*Fs:4*Fs,1), 'linewidth',2),
xlabel('time (s)')
title('The generated Oscillations')
set(gca, 'fontweight', 'bold', 'fontsize', 12)

%% 
% Now we generate the noise signals. We also calculate the power of the noise 
% signals in the narrow-bands of the oscillations. We use this powers for adjustment 
% of the SNR in the next step.

src_noise = pinknoise(T,NoiseNum);
elec_noise = src_noise * pattern_noise';

elec_noise_p = filtfilt(butter_p_b,butter_p_a,elec_noise);
elec_noise_q = filtfilt(butter_q_b,butter_q_a,elec_noise);

var_elec_noise_p = sum(var(elec_noise_p));
var_elec_noise_q = sum(var(elec_noise_q));
%% 
% The adjustment of the SNR is done in the function called |snr_adjust|, where 
% the power of each oscilaltion is adjusted based on the variance of the noise 
% in that bandwidth.

snr_cur = NaN(1,SourceNum);
%% FrP signals
for k = 1:PairsNum
    source = zeros(T,SourceNum);
    source(:,k) = src_sig_p(:,k);
    elec_sig_p = source * pattern_sig';
    var_elec_sig_p = var(elec_sig_p);
    snr_cur(k) = sum(var_elec_sig_p) / var_elec_noise_p;
end
%% FrQ signals
for k = 1:PairsNum
    source = zeros(T,SourceNum);
    source(:,PairsNum+k) = src_sig_q(:,k);
    elec_sig_q = source * pattern_sig';
    var_elec_sig_q = var(elec_sig_q);
    
    snr_cur(PairsNum+k) = sum(var_elec_sig_q) / var_elec_noise_q;
end
%% Normalize SNRs to a given value
src_sig = [src_sig_p src_sig_q];
snr_factor = sqrt(snr_cur / SNR);
src_sig = bsxfun(@rdivide,src_sig,snr_factor);
src_sig_p = src_sig(:,1:PairsNum);
src_sig_q = src_sig(:,PairsNum+1:SourceNum);
%% Mixing the Sources
% Now that the source signals and their mixing patterns are generated, we can 
% mix them and make the multi-channel signal:

src_sig = [src_sig_p src_sig_q];
elec_sig = src_sig * pattern_sig';

%% Finally, we have signals in the sensors space:
eeg = elec_sig + elec_noise;
% filter between 0.5Hz and 50Hz
[butter_preproc_b, butter_preproc_a] = butter(2,[0.5 50]/(Fs/2));
eeg = filtfilt (butter_preproc_b, butter_preproc_a, eeg);
%% 
% Now we can look at the PSD of the simulated signal:

figure,
plot_psd(eeg, Fs, 45);
title('PSD of the simulated EEG')
%% 
% The 1/f property of the spectrum is due to the pink noise sources. The peaks 
% at alpha and beta bands are the result of the energy of the simulated coupled 
% oscillations. As we see, the peaks are not visible in all the channels, because 
% we simulated only two sources and their activity is not visible in all channels. 
%% Functions

function plot_psd(x, fs, max_freq)
% a function to plot the PSD of the input signal
    [pxx,f] = pwelch(x, 2*fs, fs);
    f = f/pi * fs/2;
    pxx = pxx(f<=max_freq, :);
    f = f(f<=max_freq);
    plot(f, 10*log10(pxx), 'linewidth', 2);
    ylabel('10log_{10}(power/Hz) (dB)','fontsize', 12)
    xlabel('frequency [Hz]','fontsize', 12);
    set(gca, 'fontweight', 'bold', 'fontsize', 12)
    grid on,
